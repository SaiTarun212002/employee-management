## üöÄ Suggested Extra Features (For Improvement)

Here are some advanced or practical features you can add to make it a **full-featured backend system**:

### 1. **Search and Filter**

* üîç Filter employees by department, designation, or salary range
* ‚úÖ Endpoint: `/employees/search?department=IT&min_salary=50000`

### 2. **Pagination**

* Display employees in pages for large datasets
* ‚úÖ Endpoint: `/employees?page=1&size=10`

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**

* Restrict actions like delete/update to "admin" roles

### 4. **Switch to Database**

* Replace JSON with a real database like:

  * SQLite for local use
  * PostgreSQL/MySQL for production
* Use SQLAlchemy or Tortoise ORM

### 5. **Employee Image Upload**

* Allow uploading of profile pictures
* Store file path in employee record

### 6. **Logging and Audit Trail**

* Log when and who added, updated, or deleted an employee

### 7. **Export/Import**

* Export employee data as CSV/Excel
* Import from Excel or JSON

### 8. **Data Validation Enhancements**
